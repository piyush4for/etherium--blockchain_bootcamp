we are using next.js that include react as wrapup and include many fucntionality multi-page application , routing,
 server side rendering, hot moudle reload
	
next.js is used becoz:
	1.nextjs make run web app much much faster as it first run on .next server then it shows output html in browser while react just 
	output javascript on browser , browser parse it then show. So next js is so good for poor android internet
	2.we would run etherium requests on .next server so user who dont have metamask can run our app too

used loading button spinner and form error handling with catch in new.js 

next routes to create dynamic url/routes [just type route={anyURL} in index,header any file .it will be created]
	+routes.js also handle routes for urls

server.js tell nextJS to use routes.js that handle dynamic url i.e(next-routes)
